## Survival data

In many studies, the outcome of interest is the amount of time from an initial 
observation until the occurrence of some event of interest.

Typically, the event of interest is called a .vocab[failure] (even if it's a 
good thing), and the associated time interval between a starting point and 
failure the .vocab[failure time], .vocab[survival time], or .vocab[event time].

Examples of survival data:

- example 1
- example 2
- example 3

## Digoxin

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = '70%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/digoxin.png")
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left", out.width = '100%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/foxglove.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
- Foxgloves have been used in medicine for centuries
- Digoxin (the active ingredient) first isolated in 1930 
- Traditionally used for heart arrhythmia and heart failure
- One of the most prescribed drugs globally
]

## The DIG Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dig_trial.png")
```

Investigators compared the **primary outcome** of the number of days from the
start of the study to either death or hospitalization from worsening heart
failure.

## The DIG Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dig_trial.png")
```

.question[
How would ***you*** investigate this question, comparing the two treatment 
groups of digoxin vs. placebo?

## Challenges

The unique nature of survival data is that typically not all units are observed
until their event times:
- Maybe a patient moved to Fiji and was lost to follow-up
- Maybe a patient never experienced the primary outcome at all because they got
hit by a bus
- Maybe the study was only funded to follow patients for two years after
enrollment

--

In these cases, observations are said to be .vocab[censored] - we know that 
they survived until at least their censoring time, but do not know any further
information.

Not accounting for censoring in an appropriate way leads to **biased** and/or
**inefficient** analyses.

## Notation

Underlying data:
- $T$: Failure time, a non-negative random variable
- $C$: Censoring time, a non-negative random variable
Observed data for individual $i$:
- $Y_i$: $(T_i \wedge C_i)$, the minimum of $T_i$ and $C_i$
- $\delta_i$: $1_{(T_i \le C_i)}$, whether we observe a failure

--

If $\delta_i = 0$, then we have .vocab[right-censoring]: the survival time is
longer than the censoring time.

Commonly, we assume $C_i$ are *i.i.d.* random variables with some distribution
and that the censoring mechanism is *independent* of the failure mechanism.

## Characterizing continuous $T$

- Density function: $f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t}$

- Distribution function: $F(t) = P(T \le t) = \int_0^t f(s)ds$

- Survival function: $S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t)$

- Hazard function: $h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t}$

- Cumulative hazard function: $H(t) = \int_0^t h(s)ds$

Knowing one is equivalent to knowing the others

---

## Basic relationships

Knowing one of $f$, $F$, $S$, $h$, or $H$ uniquely specifies the others. For
example:
- $f(T) = h(t)S(t)$
- $S(T) = \exp(-H(t))$
- $H(T) = -\log(S(t))$
- etc.

---

## Survival (or survivor) function

$$S(t) = P(T > t)$$
- Non-increasing with $S(0) = 1$ and $\lim_{t \to \infty} S(t) = 0$
- For any given time $t$, a probability

---

## Hazard function

$$h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t}$$

- Instantaneous failure rate for observation, *given* already having survived to
time $t$
- **Not** a probability (for continuous $T$)
- Non-negative and unbounded for all $t$
- Often more useful interpretations than survival functions
- Nice analytical properties under right-censoring

---

## Measures of central tendency

- Mean survival:
$$ E(T) = \int_0^\infty uf(u)du = \int_0^\infty S(u)du$$
- Mean residual life:
$$ E(T - t | T > t) = \frac{\int_t^\infty S(u)du}{S(t)}$$
- Median survival: the smallest $u$ such that $S(u) = 0.5$

---

## Aside: discrete time survival 

Suppose $T$ is discrete, supported on $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$.  Define:
$$S(t) = P(T \ge t),$$
and so we have the *mass* function
$$f(a_k) = f_k = P(T = a_k),$$
for $k = 1, 2, \cdots. We have the hazard function (note that it **is** a 
probability for discrete survival)
$$h(a_k) = h_k = P(T = a_k | T \ge a_k) = \frac{f_k}{S(a_k)} = \frac{f_k}{f_k + f_{k+1} + \cdots}$$
and cumulative hazard
$$H_k = \sum_{k:a_k \le t} h_k$$

## Estimating the survival curve

The .vocab[Kaplan-Meier estimate] provides an intuitive *non-parametric* 
estimate of the survival curve
