### Some best practices

- Tell a story; have one in mind when deciding to use a visualization
- Every figure should serve a clear purpose
- A figure should stand on its own 
- Keep it simple and clear

---

### Some best practices

Make sure the type of visualization chosen is correct given the number of
variables included, their types, and their relationships. Some helpful links
are below:

- [The Data Visualization Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/)
- [The Financial Times Visual Vocabulary](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/tree/master/visual-vocabulary)

### Some best practices

Often, journals will present their own guidelines for visualizations. For 
instance, to submit an article to JAMA, a style guide for figures and their
purposes is provided [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/instructions-for-authors#SecTableofFigureRequirements) and contains the most often used 
plots for this particular journal.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning = F, message = F, out.width = "80%"}
include_graphics("img/jama1.png")
```
