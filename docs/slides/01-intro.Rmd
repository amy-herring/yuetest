## Some housekeeping...

## Create a GitHub account

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/ and create an account (unless you already have one). When you're done, click [here](https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bxqV6bAbLiYxJ2d) and enter your GitHub username.
]

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can (e.g., Twitter).
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Donâ€™t highlight your current university, employer, or place 
of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

## Access RStudio

1. Access the Duke-managed Docker containers by clicking [here](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers), 
and log in with your NetID and password. 
2. Click on the link to reserve a container for 
**RStudio - statistics application with Rmarkdown and knitr support**. You will
see a link appear similar to the one below:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '50%'} 
    knitr::include_graphics("img/01/dockers.png")
    ```

3. Click on the link to log in to your RStudio environment. 

Note that the **very first time** you run RStudio, it can take a while to load
because it is setting up some of its files (it can take a few minutes). Please
be patient!
