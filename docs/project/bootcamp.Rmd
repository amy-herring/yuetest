# Introduction

Since the 1990s, opioids have become an increasingly common method of pain 
management in Americans. However, the illicit misuse of opioids has led to a
public health crisis known colloquially as the "opioid epidemic." In 2017, 
almost 50,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose [1] and 1.7 million 
suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioids [2], 
contributing to an estimated total economic burden of $78.5 billion a year [3].

Although drug rehabilitation programs are available to combat the physical and
psychological dependency on opioid medications, patients often relapse even
after successful therapy. Lee and Rotrosen et al. conducted a study to compare
the effectiveness of two drug therapies intended to prevent opioid relapse 
during drug rehabilitation [4]. This case study is based on their study data,
which was sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). 

# Project objectives

Your goal is to provide a convincing statistical analysis comparing two
treatments in the prevention of opioid-relapse after drug rehabilitation:
extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX). What 
is the difference, if any, between these two treatments in comparing the
following factors:

- ...time-to-relapse after receipt of therapy,
- ...safety profile of the two treatments vis-a-vis adverse events?
