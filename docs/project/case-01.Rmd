# Introduction

Since the 1990s, opioids have become an increasingly common method of pain 
management in Americans. However, the illicit misuse of opioids has led to a
public health crisis known colloquially as the "opioid epidemic." In 2017, 
almost 50,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose [1] and 1.7 million 
suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioids [2], 
contributing to an estimated total economic burden of $78.5 billion a year [3].

Although drug rehabilitation programs are available to combat the physical and
psychological dependency on opioid medications, patients often relapse even
after successful therapy. Lee and Rotrosen et al. conducted a study to compare
the effectiveness of two drug therapies intended to prevent opioid relapse 
during drug rehabilitation [4]. This case study is based on their study data,
which was sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). 

# Project objectives

Your goal is to provide a convincing statistical analysis comparing two
treatments in the prevention of opioid-relapse after drug rehabilitation:
extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX). What 
is the difference, if any, between these two treatments in comparing the
following factors:

- ...time-to-relapse after receipt of therapy,
- ...proportion of patients successfully inducted into therapy, and
- ...safety profile of the two treatments vis-a-vis adverse events?

course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sta440-sp21)</b>.

# Learning objectives

**Case-specific goals:**

- Become familiar with basics of clinical trial design and analysis
- Learn visualization, inference, and applied modeling of time-to-event outcomes
- Critically evaluate existing literature and compare work from disparate
research teams.

**Overall class goals:**

- Solidify skills in reproducible research and programming, including 
version-control and collaboration via GitHub
- Critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of 
real-world data
- Express statistical models clearly and correctly
- Develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers

# Project timeline

- **Group**: Report, reproducible code, and video
  - Due Sunday, February 14
- **Individual**: Peer review and reproduction of results
  - Due Thursday, February 18
- **Group**: Revised report and response to reviewers
  - Due Tuesday, February 23
- **Individual**: Case team and peer reviewer evaluations
  - Due Thursday, February 25
  
**Note**: each team's GitHub report repository and commit history will also be
evaluated by the instructor. The GitHub repository must contain the reproducible
R Markdown document corresponding to the submitted reports, and will be checked
throughout the course of the case study to ensure all team members are making
meaningful contributions to the project.

# Extra credit opportunity

An individual extra credit opportunity worth up to 1 absolute percentage point
to your semester grade is available. The purpose of this extra credit 
assignment is to further explore reproducible research and survival analysis.
The goal is to reproduce Tables 1 and 4 from the DIG trial, which examined
the effect of digoxin on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart 
failure [6].

With only the published article, supplementary files and analysis dataset, are
you able to reproduce those tables exactly? Where are the discrepancies, if any?
