# Introduction

Baseball is one of the most popular sports in the US. In baseball, two teams 
take turns on offense and defense, where the offensive team aims to earn points 
by primarily by running bases and the defensive team aims to stop them. When a
team is on the offensive, their players take turns at bat, whereby they aim to
hit the baseball in order to give their team's players the opportunity to score
points.

Major League Baseball (MLB) is the main professional baseball organization in 
the US and had almost 70 million spectators in 2019 [1] with revenues reaching
over $10 billion [2]. Given the nature of MLB, teams are often eager to sign
the best players to their teams, at times paying over a million dollars per 
season for the best players. 

One way$^\star$ in which teams might measure the strength of a player is the
batting average (AVG), which is given by the number of successful hits divided 
by the number of times a player had an opportunity at bat. In recent years, the
league-wide average is around 0.250 (i.e., successfully hitting 25%) [3]. A
batting average greater than 0.300 is considered excellent. 

MLB franchises are split into the National League and the American League. 
American League teams allow a "designated hitter," who is a player who bats 
instead of the pitcher, whereas National League teams require that the pitchers 
themselves must bat. Keep in mind that pitchers in the National League are still
signed because they are good at pitching, not because they are good at batting.

# Project objectives

Your objective is to characterize any associations between batting average and
physical characteristics such as height, weight, and batting hand. Players 
included in the dataset are those with at least 20 at bats, were active in 2009 
onward, and were in the National League. Note that the data provided to you do
not have any information regarding the player's position.

<b>Detailed instructions, the data, and data descriptions are available in the
course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sta440-sp21)</b>.

# Learning objectives

**Case-specific goals:**

- Learn how to use the EM algorithm to address certain types of missing data
problems 
- Develop technical writing skills with respect to mathematical derivations
suitable for technical appendices

**Overall class goals:**

- Solidify skills in reproducible research and programming, including version-
control and collaboration via GitHub
- Critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of real-
world data
- Express statistical models clearly and correctly
- Develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers

# Project timeline

- **Group**: Report and reproducible code
  - Due Sunday, March 7
- **Individual**: Peer review and reproduction of results
  - Due Thursday, March 11
- **Group**: Revised report and response to reviewers
  - Due Tuesday, March 16
- **Individual**: Case team and peer reviewer evaluations
  - Due Thursday, March 18
  
**Note**: each team's GitHub report repository and commit history will also be
evaluated by the instructor. The GitHub repository must contain the reproducible
R Markdown document corresponding to the submitted reports, and will be checked
throughout the course of the case study to ensure all team members are making
meaningful contributions to the project.

# Extra credit opportunity

An individual extra credit opportunity worth up to 1 absolute percentage point
to your semester grade is available. The purpose of this extra credit 
assignment is to build your skills in basic numerical optimization techniques in
R. Your goal is to manually program a generalized linear regression model that
predicts whether a baseball player has over a 0.300 batting average *without* 
resorting to built-in functions like `glm()`.
