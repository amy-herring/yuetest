Peer Reviewer Name:
Authors of Reviewed Case Study:

Please provide thoughtful and honest feedback on the case study report assigned.  
The purpose of peer review exercises is not only to prepare you to conduct peer 
review in future jobs but also to enhance critical thinking, which should 
improve your own work. 

This initial peer review exercise will be a series of structured questions. As
we learn more about the peer review process, there will be less and less
structure in the format of your peer review.

**Please use as much space as needed to answer the questions.**

1.	Does the paper clearly articulate the authorsâ€™ research goals? (Choose one)

Yes		Somewhat 		No

(If you chose somewhat or no, please address any issues.)



2.  Are the research questions **appropriate** in answering the overall goal of
the case study? (Choose one)

Yes		Somewhat 		No

(If you chose somewhat or no, please address any issues.)



3.	Do the analyses match the research question(s) and available data? If not, 
point out problem areas.



4.	Are the methods described in enough detail that the work could be replicated 
by someone else? Is it clear what approach and model were used to evaluate 
hypotheses of interest?  If not, point out problem areas.



5.	Did you identify any errors in the report or code? If so, what are they?



6.	 Does the report contain a correct and effective interpretation of the 
results provided? Is all information needed to substantiate the results and 
conclusions (e.g., posterior probabilities, confidence intervals) included?  
If not, point out problem areas.  



7.	Are any tables and figures clear, effective, and informative?  Should any be eliminated, or are any new tables or figures needed?



8.	Is the model appropriately validated?  What type of diagnostic methods were 
used to check any modeling assumptions, and are you satisfied the assumptions of 
the model are valid? If the model is not validated (e.g., because of lack of 
data), are there compelling reasons this cannot be done?  Has any sensitivity 
analysis been done, and are the results reasonable?  Should any additional 
sensitivity analyses have been conducted? 



9.	Is the analysis easily reproduced based on the code (R file) and original
data? How long did it take you to reproduce this work, from start to finish 
(including downloading files, opening software, etc)? What challenges to
reproducibility did you face, if any?



10.	Is the paper professionally presented and generally free of distracting 
errors or other issues, including (but not limited to) insufficient organization 
or formatting; poor grammar, spelling, or punctuation; or too-small font? Is 
the overall paper easily readable for someone with your expert level of 
knowledge? Note any concerns here.



11.	What are the strengths and limitations of the analysis?  Are they clearly 
acknowledged and presented in the manuscript? What is the most interesting 
part of the author's approach to you, and why? Do you have any general 
suggestions for improvement or questions for the author? 



12.	If you had to go back and improve your own submission after giving feedback 
to this submission, what would you change?
