# Project objectives

The purpose of the open-ended individual project is for you to use your
statistical toolkit to address an outstanding research project in a principled,
reproducible way. Using a dataset of your choosing, identify an interesting
hypothesis, identify appropriate statistical methods, carry out your analysis,
and present your results in a reproducible report and oral presentation in a
way that is accessible to allied researchers.

<b>Detailed instructions are available in the course 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sta440-sp21)</b>. 

# Learning objectives

**Case-specific goals:**

- Design an appropriate statistical analysis from scratch
- Write and develop a statistically sound analysis plan
- Gain independence as a practicing statistician to tackle an open-ended 
research question of your choice

**Overall class goals:**

- Solidify skills in reproducible research and programming, including 
version-control and collaboration via GitHub
- Critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of 
real-world data
- Express statistical models clearly and correctly
- Develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers
