# Introduction

In New York City, Stop-Question-Frisk (SQF) is a police protocol that is 
intended to reduce crime by stopping, questioning, and searching civilians
suspected of engaging in misconduct. It was instituted in the early 2000s, with
SQF incidents peaking in 2011 with almost 700,000 stops [1]. However, the 
program has been frought with controversy, with many asserting that the
program unfairly targets Black and Hispanic individuals at higher rates than
Whites, Asians, or other racial groups. A 2012 statistical analysis indeed 
suggested that this was the case, "even after controlling for precinct 
variability and race-specific estimates of crime participation" [2].

In 2013, a class-action lawsuit on behalf of minority NYC residents against
New York City determined that the SQF program was used in an unconstitutional
way [3]. In settling the lawsuit, the NYPD were required to provide 
justification for any SQF event [4]. Since 2011, the number of SQF events has 
fallen sharply, with slightly over 10,000 SQF stops per year from 2016 onwards.

# Project objectives

The purpose of this case study is to determine whether there may still be 
potential evidence of disparities in SQF events and/or outcomes among Black and 
Hispanic citizens. These may be disparities in the frequency of stops, of who
gets targeted, and actions taken during and/or after the stop, or any other
potential disparity. Your analysis must take into consideration potential
spatial effects of precinct - is there evidence of any spatial correlation, and
if so, how does this play into your conclusions? 

<b>Detailed instructions, the data, and data descriptions are available on 
the Duke computing cluster</b>.

# Learning objectives

**Case-specific goals:**

- Learn common techniques for spatial data wrangling, visualization, and
inference
- Learn basics of spatial regression and interpretation
- Gain familiarity with statistical computing using the Linux-based computing
cluster

**Overall class goals:**

- Solidify skills in reproducible research and programming, including 
version-control and collaboration via GitHub
- Critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of 
real-world data
- Express statistical models clearly and correctly
- Develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers

# Project timeline

- **Group**: Report, reproducible code, and video
  - Due Sunday, March 28
- **Individual**: Peer review and reproduction of results
  - Due Thursday, April 1
- **Group**: Revised report and response to reviewers
  - Due Tuesday, April 6
- **Individual**: Case team and peer reviewer evaluations
  - Due Thursday, April 8
  
**Note**: each team's GitHub report repository and commit history will also be
evaluated by the instructor. The GitHub repository must contain the reproducible
R Markdown document corresponding to the submitted reports, and will be checked
throughout the course of the case study to ensure all team members are making
meaningful contributions to the project.

# Extra credit opportunity

An individual extra credit opportunity worth up to 1 absolute percentage point
to your semester grade is available. The purpose of this extra credit 
assignment is to create a shareable R Shiny app that may be used by others
to explore SQF data in New York City. At a minimum, you must create a graphical
overlay containing all precincts and an option for toggling by the three years
available in the dataset provided.
